*Published in 2023*
#### Abstract
Main purpose : Developing a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to identify obstacles in train tracks.
They have used over 1000 images with various types of obstacles such as rocks, trees, and other debris
DCNN has been implemented by using TensorFlow and Keras
Result : Accuracy of 98% with high sensitivity and specificity in detecting obstacles in train tracks. This proves the practical application of using DCNN in implementing to real-world scenarios to improve railway safety
#### Introduction
To avoid the risks of obstacles on rail tracks such as fallen trees, broken rails, animals, and others, a real-time obstacle detection system is necessary. However, obstacle detection systems have operated by human inspectors (manual inspections). The problem of human inspector obstacle detection system is that human can potentially make errors and it requires high maintenance costs with limited accuracy. 
Thus, authors propose Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) approach for real time obstacle detection on rail tracks. 
The model is trained with a large dataset of images or video frames that has obstacles and does not have obstacles. Once the model is trained, it predicts a new images or video frames with the output of a binary classification whether an obstacle is presenting or absenting as well as a bounding box around the detected obstacles. 
#### System Methodology
##### Collecting Data
Authors collected high quality images or videos of tracks and obstacles by several ways. 
- Cameras mounted on trains or along the tracks
- Data has been gathered in a variety of locations and conditions to prepare the real-world scenarios such as different lighting, weather conditions, variety of obstacles, and track configurations

##### Pre-Processing of Text
- Resizing
- Normalizing Images
- Removing noise and unwanted artifacts
- Augment the dataset

##### Model Training
The goal of this step is to reduce a loss function (which is calculating the difference between the predicted outputs of DCNN and the actual outputs in the pre-processed data)
- Loss functions used in DCNN:
	- cross-entropy loss, mean squared error, hinge loss
- Optimization algorithms used in DCNN:
	- Stochastic Gradient Descent, Mini-batch gradient descent, Adam
	- The process of optimization involves calculating the derivatives of the loss function with respect to the parameters and adjusting the parameters in the direction where the gradient decreases (It repeats until the loss function hits its minimum)
- Layer
	- Input Layer
		- Takes video Sequence frames as input. 
	- Convolutional Layer
		- Performs the convolution operation to learn local features from the input data 
		- This layer used pre-trained weights from MobileNetV2
	- Pooling Layer
		- Performs Max Pooling to reduce the spatial dimensions of the features and increase the spatial invariance of the model
	- LSTM Layer
		- This layer is added to capture the temporal dependencies between frames in the video
	- Fully connected Layer
		- Connects the output form the LSTM layer to the final output layer
		- Perform classification of the obstacle on the tracks
	- Output Layer
		- Produces the final prediction of whether an obstacle is present or not
#### Results and Discussion
- Metrics
	- Accuracy -Dividing the number of accurate predictions by the total number of predictions generated by the model
	- Precision, Recall, and others
	- K-fold Cross validation
- Deployment
	- Use cameras or other sensors to collect data. Mount the cameras or sensors on train so that they can continuously capture the images in real-time. The System can be designed by Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson boards. 
- Comparison

		All the metrics proves that DCNN has the best performance compare to HOG, SVM, and Haar.
#### Conclusion
The results of study propose that DCNNs can provide reliable and accurate results for obstacle detection on tracks which makes them a valuable too for enhancing rail safety in real-time.
